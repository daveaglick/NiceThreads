NiceThreads is a simple threading utility library designed to make multiple .NET threading classes easier to use through a more consistent API and various convenience classes. It started out of frustration with the different options (and more specifically, the different APIs) for enabling thread safety and locks in the .NET framework and how much code was required to use some of them. NiceThreads provides a consistent interface for standard Monitor locks and the ReaderWriterLockSlim class (and possibly others in the future). It also provides support for activating and deactivating these locking primitives through the disposable pattern. Finally, it provides wrappers that can easily provide thread-safety to unsafe objects.
